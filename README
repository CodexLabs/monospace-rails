This is an example application which uses the Stripe Javascript bindings to authenticate a credit card, and the stripe ruby bindings to create a customer and add the credit card to that customer.

Customers can also update their credit card.

* You will need a publishable token and a secret token. Add them both to config/initializers/stripe.rb.
* Install the bundler gem if you don't already have it
* Run the command "bundle" from the root of this project
* Run the command "bundle exec rake db:setup" from the root of this project
